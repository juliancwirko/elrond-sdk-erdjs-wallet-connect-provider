# mx-sdk-js-wallet-connect-provider

Signing provider for dApps: Wallet Connect. 

Documentation is available on [docs.multiversx.com](https://docs.multiversx.com/sdk-and-tools/erdjs/erdjs-signing-providers/), while an integration example can be found [here](https://github.com/multiversx/mx-sdk-js-examples/tree/main/signing-providers).

Note that **we recommend using [dapp-core](https://github.com/multiversx/mx-sdk-dapp)** instead of integrating the signing provider on your own.
